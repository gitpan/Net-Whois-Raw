NAME
    Net::Whois::Raw - Perl extension for unparsed raw whois information

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Whois::Raw;
  
      $s = whois('perl.com');
      $s = whois('funet.fi');
      $s = whois('yahoo.co.uk');

      $OMIT_MSG = 1; # This will attempt to strip several knwon copyright
                    messages and disclaimers
      $CHECK_FAIL = 1; # This will return undef if the response matches
                    one of the known patterns for a failed search.

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Whois::Raw queries NetworkSolutions and follows the Registrar:
    answer for ORG, EDU, COM and NET domains. For other TLDs it uses the
    whois-servers.net namespace. ($TLD.whois-servers.net).

    Setting the variables $OMIT_MSG and $CHECK_FAIL will match the results
    against a set of known patterns. The first flag will try to omit the
    copyright message/disclaimer, the second will attempt to determine if
    the search failed and return undef in such a case.

    IMPORTANT: these checks merely use pattern matching; they will work on
    several servers but certainly not on all of them.

MODIFICATIONS

    Fixed regular expression to match hyphens. (Peter Chow,
    peter@interq.or.jp)


    Added support for Tonga TLD. (.to) (Peter Chow, peter@interq.or.jp)


    Added support for reverse lookup of IP addresses via the ARIN registry.
    (Alex Withers awithers@gonzaga.edu) This will work now for RIPE
    addresses as well, according to a redirection from ARIN.

CLARIFICATION
    As NetworkSolutions got most of the domains of InterNic as legacy, we
    start by querying their server, as this way one whois query would be
    sufficient for many domains. Starting at whois.internic.net or
    whois.crsnic.net will result in always two requests in any case.
