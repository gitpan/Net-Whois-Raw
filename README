NAME
    Net::Whois::Raw - Get Whois information for domains

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Whois::Raw;
  
      $s = whois('perl.com');
      $s = whois('funet.fi');

      $arrayref = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_ALL');
      $text = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_LAST');
      ($text, $srv) = get_whois('yahoo.co.uk', undef, 'QRY_FIRST');

      ### if you do "use Net::Whois::Raw qw(
      #     $OMIT_MSG $CHECK_FAIL $CHECK_EXCEED
      #     $CACHE_DIR $CACHE_TIME $USE_CNAMES $TIMEOUT @SRC_IPS );
      ### you can use these:

      $OMIT_MSG = 1; # This will attempt to strip several known copyright
                    messages and disclaimers sorted by servers.
                    Default is to give the whole response.

      $OMIT_MSG = 2; # This will try some additional stripping rules
                    if none are known for the spcific server.

      $CHECK_FAIL = 1; # This will return undef if the response matches
                    one of the known patterns for a failed search,
                    sorted by servers.
                    Default is to give the textual response.

      $CHECK_FAIL = 2; # This will match against several more rules
                    if none are known for the specific server.

      $CHECK_EXCEED = 1; # When this option is set, "die" will be called
                    if connection rate to specific whois server have been
                    exceeded

      $CACHE_DIR = "/var/spool/pwhois/"; # Whois information will be
                    cached in this directory. Default is no cache.

      $CACHE_TIME = 24; # Cache files will be cleared after not accessed
                    for a specific number of hours. Documents will not be
                    cleared if they keep get requested for, independent
                    of disk space. Default is not to clear the cache.

      $USE_CNAMES = 1; # Use whois-servers.net to get the whois server
                    name when possible. Default is to use the 
                    hardcoded defaults.

      $TIMEOUT = 10; # Cancel the request if connection is not made within
                    a specific number of seconds.

      @SRC_IPS = (11.22.33.44); # List of local IP addresses to
                    use for WHOIS queries. Addresses will be used used
                    successively in the successive queries

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Whois::Raw queries WHOIS servers about domains. The module supports
    recursive WHOIS queries. Also queries via HTTP is supported for some
    TLDs.

    Setting the variables $OMIT_MSG and $CHECK_FAIL will match the results
    against a set of known patterns. The first flag will try to omit the
    copyright message/disclaimer, the second will attempt to determine if
    the search failed and return undef in such a case.

    IMPORTANT: these checks merely use pattern matching; they will work on
    several servers but certainly not on all of them.

FUNCTIONS
    whois( DOMAIN [, SRV] )
       Returns Whois information for "DOMAIN". Without "SRV" argument
       default Whois server for specified domain name zone will be used. Use
       'www_whois' as server name to force WHOIS querying via HTTP (only few
       TLDs are supported in HTTP queries). Caching is supported: if
       $CACHE_DIR variable is set and there is cached entry for that domain
       - information from the cache will be used.

    get_whois( DOMAIN [, SRV [, WHICH_WHOIS]] )
       Lower-level function to query Whois information for "DOMAIN". Caching
       IS NOT supported (caching is implemented only in higher-level "whois"
       function). Without "SRV" argument default Whois server for specified
       domain name zone will be used. "WHICH_WHOIS" argument is used to
       access a results if recursive queries; possible values:

       'QRY_FIRST' - returns results of the first query. Non't make
       recursive queries. In scalar context returns just whois text. In list
       context returns two values: whois text and whois server which was
       used to make query).

       'QRY_LAST' - returns results of the last query. In scalar context
       returns just whois text. In list context returns two values: whois
       text and whois server which was used to make query). This is the
       default option.

       'QRY_ALL' - returns results of the all queries of the recursive
       chain. Reference to array of references to hashes is returned. Hash
       keys: "text" - result of whois query, "srv" - whois server which was
       used to make query.
