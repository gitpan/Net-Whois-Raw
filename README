Net::Whois::Raw returns raw unparsed whois information.
It follows references to other registrars by Network Solutions, it uses
the <tld>.whois-servers.net notion

APOLOGY

Versions 0.08 to 0.10 of Net::Whois::Raw were primarily failed upload
attempts, as I don't have any personal UNIX box now.
I know you need this module, and apologize for the inconvience
